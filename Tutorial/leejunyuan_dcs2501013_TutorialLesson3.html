A <strong><big><em>shepherd</em></big></strong> boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields
near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.
</font>
</p>
<br>

<p align=left>
<font size=4>
One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but didn't find any wolf.
</font>

The boy laughed and replied, "It was just fun. There is no wolf here". <strong><big><em>The boy played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</em></big></strong>

After some days, while the shepherd bot was in the field with the herd of sheep, suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs. The boy was frightened and cried loudly, "Wolf! Wolf! <strike>The wolf is carrying a lamb away!"</strike>
